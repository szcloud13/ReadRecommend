COMP3900 Diary
Monica Ng (z5025097)

Week 1

- Group formed. Join Github classroom and Jira. Decided on what software project to implement.

Week 2

- Discussed user stories and created draft of the project proposal. 
- Worked on User Stories and Storyboards for the project proposal.
- Familiarised myself with React and Typescript. Created basic front end for home/landing page.

Week 3

- Finalised project proposal. Created basic front end for sign up and sign in pages, and worked with Simon to attach this to the backend.
- The main challenges this week were getting used to programming and debugging React and Typescript code as I have not worked on frontend before.

Week 4

- Implemented the front-end for creating collections for a user, as well as as editing collections 
-> this included the UI and functionality for renaming collections, adding to and removing books from collections, as well as adding and deleting tags from collections.
- The main focus was to get all the front end features communicating properly with the backend API endpoints. 
- Some things that were not implemented include various alerts/feedback on the UI to tell users whether their actions were successful or unsucessful.
Whilst the implementation of these features would enhance the user experience, I was more focused on implementing the main functionality first.
I plan to roll out the implementation of this over the whole course of the project as different features on the frontend are implemented.  

Week 5

- Building on last week's work, this week was focused on getting the product ready for demo.
- The first demo of our project was conducted this week and we showcased all the implemented user stories that were part of the first sprint.
- We weren't able to implement the top 10 most recently added books in a collection during this sprint as this would require changes in the backend 
that would affect some of the other implemented features. Collectively, we decided we did not want to accidentally break existing functionality.
- In the next 1-2 weeks, we plan to agree on an appropriate representation of books and collections that would support the 'most recently added books' feature.
We also plan on implementing all the features allocated to the upcoming sprint. 

Week 6

- This week was flexibility week and so my workload was lighter than other weeks. Here, I decided to work on addressing some of the feedback received in the first demo.
- I implemented a double password confirmation field on the sign up page, as well as different alerts for increased user feedback.
- I added some error handling to ensure that users couldn't create multiple collections with the same name.  
- There were no major technical obstacles this week as a few of the other members in the group were taking a short break.
- Next week I plan to start working on building out the main features allocated in the sprint (reading status for books and goal setting).

Week 7

- Implemented the front end for "read status" for books in a user's library (main collection). This feature allows users to mark a book as read or unread and is crucial for measuring the
completion of user reading goals to be implemented next week.
- Some issues were are working on resolving include functionality for users to add books that are not on the platform's system into their personalised collections.
To address this, Simon is looking into scraping book data from external APIs.  

Week 8

- This week I worked on implementing front-end for the goal setting feature for users. This entails users being able to set monthly reading goals which are saved to their profile,
and being able to see their progress with past goals on a line chart that displays the number of books read over each "goal period".
- The main technical obstacle was around collaborating with backend on how we wanted to represent and implement the notion of a user goal.
To resolve this, many discussions were held in the planning phase. Additionally, I worked closely with Jiayi during the implementation phase to ensure smooth
connection between the frontend and backend. 
- The second demo of our project was held this week, where we showcased all completed features. The only features not implemented at this stage were the calculation
and display of aggregate statistics, as well as the filtering and recommendation modes. 

Week 9

- This week we aimed to finalise our code for the project. I worked on the frontend features for editing reading goals, as well as filtering capabilities in book search.

Week 10

- This week I worked on minor bug fixes and adding user feedback for a range of actions to make our website more user-friendly. 
I also worked on the "Functionalities" section of the project report and prepared for final submission.
