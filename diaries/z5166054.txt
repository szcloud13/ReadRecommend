Week 8
I worked on the apis in the backend for reading goals, I had issues with how the goals were to be implemented as there wasn't a clear consensus on how the goals would work. After discussions with the group we all came to a general agreement and understanding of goals, which I then implemented. This week was also the second demo where we presented all the stories for that sprint.

Week 9
This week we are working to finish of the all the features that are left. I worked on several recommendation apis, including recommendation based on reading history, based on books in a user's library. I also implemented a keyword search that finds books with specified keywords in the description.
